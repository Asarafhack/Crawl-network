# Network Crawling and Visualization

This project enables network crawling and visualization of network data. It provides tools to gather network information and visualize it through interactive dashboards.

## Features

- **Network Crawling**: Automatically crawl network devices and gather data.
- **Visualization**: Interactive visualizations to analyze network data.
- **Custom Reports**: Generate reports based on network crawling results.

## Project Structure

- `crawler.py`: Python script for crawling network devices.
- `visualization.py`: Python script for visualizing network data.
- `data/`: Directory for storing crawled network data.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the web interface.
- `static/`: Static files including CSS and JavaScript for styling and functionality.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Required Python Packages**: List of Python packages needed for this project.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

In your terminal or command prompt, execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-crawling-visualization.git
cd network-crawling-visualization
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

Install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

1. **Update Configuration Files**: Modify configuration files (e.g., `config.json`) with network settings and visualization preferences.

## Usage

### 1. Crawl the Network

Run the network crawler script:

```bash
python crawler.py
```

This script will scan the network and save the data in the `data/` directory.

### 2. Visualize Network Data

Run the visualization script:

```bash
python visualization.py
```

This will start a local server and open the visualization dashboard in your web browser.

### 3. Access the Dashboard

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to view the network data visualizations.

### 4. Generate Reports

Reports can be generated based on the crawled network data. Refer to the documentation in the `visualization.py` script for details on report generation.

## Example Output

- **Crawling Results**: Details of network devices and their attributes.
  
  ```plaintext
  Device IP: 192.168.1.1
  Device Type: Router
  MAC Address: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
  ```

- **Dashboard View**: Interactive charts and graphs representing network data.

## Troubleshooting

- **Dependencies Issues**: Ensure all required Python packages are installed and up-to-date.
- **Network Access**: Verify that the crawler has the necessary permissions and network access.
- **Server Errors**: Check the console for any error messages and refer to the documentation for potential solutions.

## Notes

- **Data Privacy**: Handle network data responsibly and in accordance with privacy regulations.
- **Performance**: The performance of crawling and visualization may vary based on network size and system capabilities.
